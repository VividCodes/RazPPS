<h1>Penus Is Very Nice Let Me Inform You Why.</h1>
<div id="introduction">
<h2>How Penus Get Hard</h2>
<p><em>During sexual arousal, nerve messages begin to stimulate the penis.
 Impulses from the brain and local nerves cause the muscles of the corpora cavernosa to relax, allowing blood to flow in and fill the open spaces.
 The blood creates pressure in the corpora cavernosa, making the penis expand and creating an erection.</em></p>

</div>
<div><h2>Why Penus Get Random Hard</h2>
<p><strong>Males often experience erections, sometimes called boners, without physical or psychological stimulation.
 While it is usually not a cause for concern, it can feel embarrassing.
 Random erections are normal in adolescents and adults, especially when waking up.
 Fluctuations in testosterone may be responsible.</strong></p></div>
